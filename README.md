# Electrostatic_phase_plate
Source code for the image analysis of electron holography characterization of an electrostatic phase plate

**In the repository**:
Python File for the image analysis of both 2D profiles and 1D linescan between each electrode in the phase plate.

**The packages/libraries used for analysis are:**
 * Numpy (NP)
 * Matplotlib for plotting and image show
 * Hyperspy (Holography, https://hyperspy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/electron_holography.html)
 * Skimage for phase unwrapping (Hyperspy's Phase Unwrapping is that from Skimage)
